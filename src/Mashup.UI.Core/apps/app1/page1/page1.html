    <h3>Here's how this works</h3>

    <p>ng-router - parses the url and based on the router configuration grabs the html fragment and JS controller and orchestates them so they are bound to each other.</p>
    <p>The new view is placed into the angular directive ng-view of the index.html.  The index.html is, essentially, the only page that ever gets loaded.</p>
    <p>The router configuration is currently stored in the route.config.js file.  This might not be the final resting place of this configuration.  It could become data driven or more modularized so each application could have it's own router config file.  The challenge is deep linking.  With deep linking we can take the URL and recreate our environment with only what is provided in the link.  If we do this then we need all router config.</p>
    <p>You'll find the href used to pull up this page in page2.html and menu.html</p>
