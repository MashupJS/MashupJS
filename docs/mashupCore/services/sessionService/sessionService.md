#sessionService
The **Mashup** is a learning tool that also starts as a bootstrap project for line-of-business applications.

The **sessionService** shares session information between modules.

##Purpose
A great way to share information between modules, in Angular, is via services.

The sessionService provides, to modules, any information they need about the user, environment, and any other session specific data a module might need.

##userSession
Exposed by the **sessionService** the *userSession* holds whatever information is returned by the AuthN/AuthR system chosen.  The expected properties are not defined but rather inherited by whatever system is providing AuthN/AuthR services.
```
var userSession = {};
```
When this user information is retrieved by the application the *setUserSession* function is called.  

The *sessionService* is not tasked with retrieving this information but only holding it for modules to consume.

##envSession
Environment information is exposed by the **sessionService** via *envSession*.

Retrieving environment information doesn't not require external access to databases or WebApi(s) so the separation of responsibilities is not to badly abused when the **sessionService** retrieves environmental information on it's own.

**envSession** is a good candidate for being modularized by a *utlity_* module.

Some user/environment session properties include:

- browser: "Chrome 38.0.2125.101"
- deviceType: "desktop"
- osName: "Windows"
- battery level
