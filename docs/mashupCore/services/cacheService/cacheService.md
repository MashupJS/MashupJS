## Introduction

###Brief
One of the benefits of SPA applications is the decoupling of dependence on external resources. Composition of the view and controller are done locally and page processing, in AngularJS, is local where it once occurred on a web server.
Taking this decoupling one step further with data independence gives you an offline capability. When offline the application would continue to function properly while gracefully handling connection drops and re-connects.
