#index.html
In a SPA application this is the only web page that ever truly loads.  This is your single page in the SPA (Single Page Application).

##Application Layout
The index.html controls the layout of the application.


##Swappable
The *separation of responsibilities* provided by the MVVM (ModelView-ViewModel) nature of Angular makes it easy to swap out the index.html file for your own while reusing the indexController.js.

Create your own index.html file and menu system then post it back for others to use.
