#Create WebApi for the Mashup & CORS
The **Mashup** is a learning tool that also serves as a bootstrap project for line-of-business applications.

The WebApi or any restFul service provides back-end support for SPA applications.

###Intro

This is a step-by-step tutorial for creating a WebApi for the Mashup.

The WebApi provides the back-end support for your Angular application.  A typical SPA application with Angular will consist of a WebApi and index.html page on the same web site.  This is an easy configuration to spin up and start coding against.

The challenge comes when your application grows and your enterprise expects to share programming resources.  The client may no longer be coming from the same domain and you enter into cross domain sharing of resources.  CORS comes into play.

Here is a step-by-step tutorial for creating a WebApi for the Mashup that addresses the CORS issue.

###Creating the WebApi
Using Visual Studio add a new project to your existing Angular solution.

Right click the solution and select **Add -> New Project**.

Select **ASP.NET Web Application** and give your project a **name** then press **OK**.

The template page loads.

Select **Web API** in the "Select a template" section.

 **MVC** and **Web API** will be automatically selected.

Select "Change Authentication" and select **No Authentication** and press **OK**.

Verify **Host in the cloud** is unchecked.

Press **OK**.

Using the selected template and settings Visual Studio creates the new Web API.

###Getting CORS to work
CORS support is already built into the Web Api.  What we need to do is add headers to requests so Chrome and Firefox can access our resources.

> NOTE: I've had inconsistent experiences with WebApi and CORS.  Make sure you've installed the NuGet package giving you **Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors**.

> Add the code, below, to your Global.asax in the pulic class Global.

```
protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (Context.Request.Path.Contains("api/") && Context.Request.HttpMethod == "OPTIONS")
    {

	Context.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", Context.Request.Headers["Origin"]);
	Context.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
	Context.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
	Context.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
	Context.Response.End();
    }
} 
```

Enable CORS by adding the following to the Register function of the WebApiConfig.cs
```
// Enabling CORS Globally
var cors = new EnableCorsAttribute("*", "*", "*") { SupportsCredentials = true };
config.EnableCors(cors);
```

Add the following to the include session of the WebApiConfig.cs.
```
using System.Web.Http.Cors;
```


###Attribute Routing

To enable **Attribute Routing** add the following code to your **App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs" file.

>OK, nevermind.  Since the last time I did this it seems the new Web API tempate does this for you.  Here is the code that makes Attribute Routing possible.

```
// Web API routes
config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();
```

> With the rapid changes in technology it can almost be a detrimental to be an early adopter.  As you see, above, I was expecting to write extra configuration code but since the time I created the first Mashup Web APIs the Visual Studio templates have been improved.
>
>You might have noticed the old template only created **WebApiConfig.cs** and the new template creates both the **WebApiConfig.cs** and **RouteConfig.cs** templates.

>This leads me to believe I should make it a practice to periodically recreate my projects with whatever the latest Visual Studio templates are.  This might be a best practice for all 3rd party libraries.

> This would be an effort to keep **Technical Debt** to a minimum.  As the projects we create age they become liabilities.  It seems to me the effort to keep projects current is less if done more frequently with fewer changes between versions.


###Create an endpoint to test.

In the NewWebAPI's Controllers directory create two files.

 - Item.cs - as a class with the following content.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace **Leave your namespace here**
{
    public class Item
    {
        public int id { get; set; }
        public string action { get; set; }
        public bool done { get; set; }
        public DateTime completed { get; set; }
        public decimal myDecimal { get; set; }
        public double myDouble { get; set; }
        public long myLong { get; set; }
        public string contact { get; set; }
        public string doneWithIndeterminate { get; set; }
    }
}
```

 - ItemController.cs

Add the following code to it.  Remember to swap out your namespace.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Web.Http;

namespace **Leave your namespace here**
{
    [Authorize] // Even though this says "Authorize" it should require the user to be at least Authenticated.
    public class ItemController : ApiController
    {
        List<Item> _items = new List<Item> {
            new Item { id = 1, action = "Buy Gloves", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("5/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 2, action = "Get Hair cut", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("5/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.2m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 3, action = "Collect Tickets", done = true, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("5/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.3m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 4, action = "Call Joe", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("5/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.4m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 5, action = "Check TODO List", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("6/28/2014"), myDecimal = 2.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 6, action = "Call the tax dude", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("6/28/2014"), myDecimal = 2.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name1@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 7, action = "Feed the dogs", done = true, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("6/28/2014"), myDecimal = 2.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 8, action = "Start spring cleaning", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("6/28/2014"), myDecimal = 3.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 9, action = "Schedule checkup", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("7/28/2014"), myDecimal = 3.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 10, action = "Sweep porch", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("7/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.1m, myDouble = 1.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 11, action = "Do dishes", done = true, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("7/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.1m, myDouble = 2.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 12, action = "Take out trash", done = false, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("7/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.1m, myDouble = 2.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"},
            new Item { id = 13, action = "Do your homework!", done = true, completed = Convert.ToDateTime("1/28/2014"), myDecimal = 1.1m, myDouble = 3.00, myLong = 64, contact = "name2@domain.com"}
        };


        [Route("api/Items")]
        [HttpGet]
        public List<Item> GetAllItems()
        {
            return _items;
        }

        [Route("api/Items/{id:int:min(2)}")]
        [HttpGet]
        public List<Item> GetItem(int id)
        {
            var items = new List<Item>();

            var item = _items.FirstOrDefault((p) => p.id == id);

            items.Add(item);
            return items;
        }


    }
}
```

###JSON Formatter
Before we call this new Web Api lets tell it to return all data as JSON.

Open your **App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs** file and copy this line at the end.

```
// By default Web Api wants to return XML.  (This is confusing because RestFul is based on JSON)
// This line changes the default return type to JSON.
config.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes.Add(new MediaTypeHeaderValue("text/html"));
```

This will require a new using statement.
```
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
```

###Help page
You'll notice many more files, created by the template we used, than are necessary to create a WebApi.  This is because the WebApi template also creates a web UI.  You can build off this UI but our intention is only to use the UI as a helper for building WebApi(s).

> I'm choosing to keep the UI pieces because I like the Help feature.  It would not be unreasonable to remove all files except those needed to create the WebApi.  In fact, if this is your intent up front then rather than select WebApi as a template select Empty as your template then MVC and WebApi below, when adding the new project.  This tutorial was originally based on this approach so we know it works.

We are not interested in seeing the start page when we start up this project so we'll make a slight modification to this projects properties.

Right click on the project we just created in the Solution Explorer and select **Properties**.

Select the **Web** tab then change the value of Specific Page to "Help".

###Call the WebApi

Set the new WebApi as the startup project and press the Run button in Visual Studio.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MashupJS/MashupJS/master/docs/mashupApi/10.PNG)

Enter **localhost:49261/api/Items**

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MashupJS/MashupJS/master/docs/mashupApi/11.PNG)

You might have a jumbled mess of JSON on your screen.  To clean that up you'll want to use some kind of browser plug-in.  What I'm using here is JSONView.
