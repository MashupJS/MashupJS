MashupJS
========
The Mashup is an attempt to leverage modern web stack technologies and techniques to address technical debt, establish an enterprise ready bootstrap, and to learn and teach AngularJS.

- One code base for all platforms including web, tablet, and mobile applications.

- Bootstrap for large enterprise applications leveraging lazy loading, built in cache options, advanced routing.

- Build your personal and team code library. Use for learning and teaching.


##Getting Started

 1. Install NodeJS
 2. Install gulp
	 - `npm install gulp -g`
 3. Install bower
	 - `npm install bower -g`
 4. Download and unzip this repository
 5. Create a place to work with the "src" folder
 5. Install npm packages
	 - `npm install`
 6. Install bower packages
	 - `bower install`
 6. Build the project
	 - `gulp`
 7. Fire up Visual Studio and load the .sln file or use your favorite IDE.

> If using Visual Studio change the Project (menu) --> Mashup.UI.Core properties (menu item) --> Web (tab)

> - change "`Start Action`" to "`Specific Page`" with a value of "`dist/index.html`".
> - The dist folder won't exist until after you've executed the gulp task.

##Design

 - **[Directory Structure](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupStyleGuides/Mashup-StyleGuide.md#directory-structure-of-mashupuicore)**
 - **[Defining Routes](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupStyleGuides/Mashup-StyleGuide.md#defining-routes)**
 - Drop-in Application Support allowing teams to divide up their applications and combine them during deployment.
  - **[Applications Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/apps/apps.md)**
  - **[Dynamic Menu Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/config/mashupMenu.md)**
  - **[Dynamic Routing Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/config/routeConfig.md)**


TODO: add to Arch/Comp
- Much of this is in the style guide. Reference that where possible.
- Create graphs and other artifacts that make using the Mashup easily understandable and supportable.
- Add enough design that a company using the Mashup can consider the system well documented.

##The MashupJS Style Guide

**[MashupJS Style Guide](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupStyleGuides/Mashup-StyleGuide.md)**

The MashupJS Style Guide describes how to use the Mashup and opinionated best practices.

Additionally this Guide links to other popular style guides.

*TODO: add style guides for WebApi, C#, Grunt/Gulp, etc.*

##MashupJS Implementations

#### [Basic MashupJS](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/tree/master/src)

This is a good place to begin.  This is the implementation referred in the **Getting Started** section of this document.
 
####`npm install mashupjs`

 - Link to 3D UI example apps


##Features available to all Mashup applications
All applications added to the Mashup will receive many features for free.  This goes a long way to reducing technical debt.  The basic/standard plumbing all applications need in your environment can be built once, maintained in one place, and a benefit to all your applications.

**Here is a running list of features:**

 - Drop-in Application Support
   - **[Dynamic Menu Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/config/mashupMenu.md)**
   - **[Dynamic Routing Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/config/routeConfig.md)**
 - Bootstrap for Large Enterprise Applications
	 - **[Applications Support](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/apps/apps.md)**
 - One Code Base for all Platforms
 - **[Swappable index.html /w (SoC)](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/index.html.md)**

 - Shared Build System
 - Shared Services, Filters, Directives, and any other custom JS code
 - **[Lazy loading of HTML templates and JavaScript modules](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/config/routeConfig.md#lazy-loading)**
 - Shared User Alert System
 - **[Retrieval of Client Information for troubleshooting](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/sessionService/sessionService.md#envsession)**
 - [**Instrumentation** (easily track the pages and features users use)](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/logService/logService.md#instrumentation)


##Core Services

 - Alert Service
	 - Not documented. It's a simple alert that will be replaced by John Papa's toaster.
 - **[Cache Service](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/cacheService/cacheService.md)**
 - **[Detect Service](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/detectService/detectService.md)**
 - **[Log Service](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/logService/logService.md)**
 - **[Utility Service Facade](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/utilityService/utilityService.md)**
 - [**Multi-Auth Session support** - Documentation needs updated to reflect how the new session works.](https://github.com/MashupJS/mashupjs.doc/blob/master/docs/mashupCore/services/sessionService/sessionService.md)
 


##Roadmap
 - Application Level User Management
 - Exception Management (Dashboard, granular config)
 - Instrumentation (Dashboard, granular config)
 - Ionic integration for hybrid-apps
 - Shared at a glance monitoring of the system.  Can filter by user, group, application, etc.
 - Background lazy-loading of js files
