
I want to set up the mashup so only the core is in one place and apps that use the core, for example purposes, can be in another directory using Github Submodules to manage the core source for daily changes and an NPM package for stable releases.

Pardon the tempMashupJS directory until I get this worked out.  Once I do the Github repository will be the single repository of truth.
